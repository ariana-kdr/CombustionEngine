# CombustionEngine

GitHub has issues reading .mlx files but we can use a bit of a work-around for this and this should not impact our ability to track changes. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE REPOSITORY

The existing code uploaded here is from an .m file, while the code we are working on in MATLAB is a .mlx file. In order to use GitHub it looks like we need to convert between .m and .mlx when making changes, but this is not particularly hard. The easiest way is probably to have a .m file and a .mlx file of the code constantly on your computer and update both of these when you make changes.  

If you want to make a change to the existing code in GitHub, copy the code and save it to your local .m file. Then save this file as a local .mlx file in order to work with it as a live script on your computer, if that's your preference. 

After you've made the desired changes, save this as an .m file as well. Copy the code from the updated .m file back into the code on GitHub and save it here. This updates the code on GitHub but you still have the option to compare with the previous version of the code. This option is not there if you upload the code as an .mlx file.
